This is a fork of [tjvr/scratchblocks], consider sending issues / PRs there. I will try to keep up with changes in tjvr.

---

For **pull requests**:

* Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 4.0 installed.

* Install packages:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

* Start the web-server:

  ```
  npm start
  ```

* Browse to <http://localhost:8080/> to access the development version.

* Before you send a PR, run `npm test` and take a look at the output in the `tests` folder.

To refetch the translations (eg. to take into account new updates on [Pootle](translate.scratch.mit.edu/)), use `npm run translations`.
